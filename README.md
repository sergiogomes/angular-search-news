- Search results should be limited to 20 and presented as a list.
- Each row in the list should have two columns - title, description, author in the first column and thumbnail image in another column.
- The layout should be responsive.

## Optional Features(Extra Points)

- Clicking on the thumbnail image should open a modal with the image centered both horizontally and vertically.
- Create a button that sorts the results by title alphabetically, toggle between descending and ascending.
